This project fetches data from the official TMDB API and allows users to search, filter, and save favorites.

Built to practice and demonstrate front-end development skills with Angular, TypeScript, RxJS, and localStorage.

🤔 Why this project?

This app was developed to apply Angular fundamentals while adding custom features.
I focused on:

Structuring modules, components, and services clearly

Integrating an external API (TMDB) with error handling

Managing local persistence (favorites/watchlist)

Ensuring responsive, mobile-friendly design

Thinking like a developer building a product, not just a student project
